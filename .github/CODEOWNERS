# In order to utilize the [settings app](https://github.com/apps/settings) in a
# secure manner, we must ensure that both the `CODEOWNERS` and `settings.yml`
# file have code owners and that `settings.yml` has
# `require_code_owner_reviews: true`.
# We do not mark code owners for other directories as the code owners will be
# auto-assigned first by github, preventing the use of team auto-assignment.
